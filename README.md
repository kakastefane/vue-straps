# Vue Straps Project

> A Vuejs 2 | Boostrap 4 | Font-awesome 4 | Sass | Compass | Jquery | Webpack project

## Info

This project was born because of the difficulty in adding Sass and Compass preprocessor in the webpack. Sleep nights were lost to use Sass and Compass with webpack.

I like to use Bootstrap + Vuejs + Sass + Compass in my projects. If you also like these, just use it.

There is an initial sass structure, but feel free to leave it your way.

## Project Struture

* Sass  : src / assets / sass
* Vuejs : src / assets / components
* Images: src / images or static
* Jquery: src / js 

## Build Setup

Step-by-step to use:

* git clone the project
* npm install (install the dependencies)
* npm run dev (start the server)
* npm run build (building app)

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
